Industry average L. salmonis motiles per fish,"Lepeophtheirus salmonis is the scientific name for the salmon louse. Motiles refers to female and male preadult and adult stages of the salmon louse. This column shows the average number of motile L. salmonis per farmed salmon examined by industry. From March 1 to June 30, the regulatory threshold is three motiles per fish.  "

Comments,Comments include details about the statistical agreement between industry and DFO sea lice counts and indicates if follow-up actions were required.
Year Class,"Year class refers to the amount of time the farmed fish population has spent in seawater. One is less than a year, two is greater than a year.  "
Statistical agreement between DFO and Industry counts,"On the day of the audit, samples of fish are pulled from various pens as per licence conditions. Equal numbers of fish are randomly selected to be counted either by industry personnel or DFO auditors. A non-parametric Two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test is used to determine statistical agreement between industry counts and DFO counts. When there is statistical agreement between the counts (p-value < 0.05), the counting methodology of the licence holder is deemed to be in compliance with licence conditions. "
"Statistically significant difference between DFO and Industry counts; Difference attributed to sample selection, methodology meets requirements outlined in licence conditions","On the day of the audit, samples of fish are pulled from various pens as per licence conditions. Equal numbers of fish are randomly selected to be counted either by industry personnel or DFO auditors. A non-parametric Two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test is used to determine statistical agreement between industry counts and DFO counts. In some cases there is not agreement between the counts (p-value > 0.05), but DFO auditors observed appropriate counting methodology by industry. In these instances the statistical difference is attributed to random sample selection difference between DFO and industry counters. No compliance follow-up actions are required, but this event is tracked to ensure subsequent counts match DFO's."
Statistically significant difference between DFO and Industry counts; Follow-up actions taken,"On the day of the audit, samples of fish are pulled from various pens as per licence conditions. Equal numbers of fish are randomly selected to be counted either by industry personnel, or DFO auditors. A non-parametric Two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test is used to determine statistical agreement between industry counts and DFO counts. In some cases there is not agreement between the counts (p-value > 0.05), and DFO auditors observed counting methodology that does not meet requirements outlined in licence conditions. In these instances follow-up actions are required. This could include additional training for industry staff, changes in protocols, or non-compliance actions by DFO. These events are tracked to ensure methodoly improves in subsequent audits."
Audit included only one pen; Audit included only 2 pens,Licence conditions require that three pens of fish are sampled in a sampling event. In some cases circumstances are such that only one or two pens were included in the audit. These results are still reported.
